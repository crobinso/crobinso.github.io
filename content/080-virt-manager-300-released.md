Status: published

Yesterday I released [virt-manager 3.0.0](https://www.redhat.com/archives/virt-tools-list/2020-September/msg00003.html). Despite the major version number bump, things shouldn't look too different from the previous release. For me the major version number bump reflects certain feature removals (like dropping virt-convert), and the large amount of internal code changes that were done, though there's a few long awaited features sprinkled in like virt-install `--cloud-init` support which I plan to write more about later.

This release includes:

* virt-install --cloud-init support ([Athina Plaskasoviti](https://athinapl.home.blog/2019/08/25/gsoc-2019-cloud-init-configuration-for-virt-manager-virt-install/), Cole Robinson)
* [The virt-convert tool has been removed](https://blog.wikichoon.com/2020/07/virt-convert-removed.html). Please use virt-v2v instead
* A handful of UI XML configuration options have been removed, in an effort to reduce maintenance ongoing maintenance burden, and to be more consistent with what types of UI knobs we expose. The [XML editor](https://blog.wikichoon.com/2020/07/virt-manager-xml-editor.html) is an alternative in most cases. For a larger discussion see [this thread](https://www.redhat.com/archives/virt-tools-list/2019-June/msg00117.html) and virt-manager's [DESIGN.md](https://github.com/virt-manager/virt-manager/blob/master/DESIGN.md) file.
* The 'New VM' UI now has a 'Manual Install' option which creates a VM without any required install media
* In the 'New VM' UI, the network/pxe install option has been removed. If you need network boot, choose 'Manual Install' and set the boot device after initial VM creation
* 'Clone VM' UI has been reworked and simplified
* 'Migrate VM' UI now has an XML editor for the destination VM
