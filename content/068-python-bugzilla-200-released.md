I'm happy to announce a new release of python-bugzilla, version 2.0.0.

This release contains several small to medium API breaks as [previously mentioned](https://blog.wikichoon.com/2016/06/python-bugzilla-api-changes-in-git.html) on the blog. If you hit any issues, check that page first to see if it's an expected change.
