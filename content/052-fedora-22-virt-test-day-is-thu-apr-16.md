A reminder that the Fedora 22 Virt Test Day is this coming Thu Apr 16. Check out the test day landing page:

It's a great time to make sure your virt workflow is still working correctly with the latest packages in Fedora 22. No requirement to run through test cases on the wiki, just show up and let us know what works (or breaks).

Updating to a development release of Fedora scares some people, but it's NOT required to help out with the test day: you can test the latest virt bits on the latest Fedora release courtesy of the virt-preview repo. For more details, as well as easy instructions on updating to Fedora 22, see:

<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2015-04-16_Virtualization#What.27s_needed_to_test>

Though running latest Fedora 22 on a physical machine is still preferred :)

If you want to help out, pop into \#fedora-test-day on Thursday and give us a shout!
