I've just released virt-manager 1.0.1. This was mostly a bug fix release to gather up the sizeable number of bug fixes that accumulated since [virt-manager 1.0.0](https://blog.wikichoon.com/2014/02/virt-manager-100-released.html) was released last month.

Though there were a few mini features added:

-   virt-install/virt-xml: New --memorybacking option (Chen Hanxiao)
-   virt-install/virt-xml: New --memtune option (Chen Hanxiao)
-   virt-manager: UI for LXC <idmap> (Chen Hanxiao)</idmap>
-   virt-manager: gsettings key to disable keygrab (Kj√∂ Hansi Glaz)
-    virt-manager: Show domain state reason in the UI (Giuseppe Scrivano)
-    Support for many more device live update operations, like changing the network source for a running VM, etc.

Builds inprogress for F20 and rawhide
