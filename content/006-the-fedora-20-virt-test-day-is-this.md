The Fedora 20 Virt Test Day is this coming Tuesday, October 8th. Check out the test day landing page:

<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2013-10-08_Virtualization>

If you're interested in trying out some new virt functionality, there's step by step instructions for:

* Snapshot UI in virt-manager
* Running ARM VMs on x86 with libvirt/virt-manager
* Libvirt ACLs for granting a user access to only a single VM

Even if you aren't interested in testing new features, we still need you! The test day is the perfect time to make sure your virt workflow is working fine on Fedora 20, as there will be several developers on hand to answer any questions, help with debugging, provide patches, etc. No requirement to run through test cases on the wiki, just show up and let us know what works (or breaks).

And to be clear, while it is preferred that you have a physical machine running Fedora 20, participating in the test day does NOT require it: you can test the latest virt bits on the latest Fedora release courtesy of the virt-preview repo. For more details, as well as easy instructions on updating to Fedora 20, see:

<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Test_Day:2013-10-08_Virtualization#What.27s_needed_to_test>

If you can't make the date of the test day, adding test case results to the wiki anytime next week is fine as well. Though if you do plan on showing up to the test day, add your name to the participant list on the wiki, and when the day arrives, pop into \#fedora-test-day on freenode and give us a shout!
