Third times the charm! With the ongoing [F21 alpha delay](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/devel/2014-September/202100.html), I requested the virt test day to be pushed back yet again. Now it's on Thursday September 25th. Check out the landing page for more info on the test day:

Since I'm tired of making these announcements, even if F21 is delayed some more I won't be rescheduling the test day again, so September 25th is the _super official_ date. :)
