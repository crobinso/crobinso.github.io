This is Cole Robinson's website. A bit about me:

* Software engineer working on virtualization at Red Hat since 2006.
* Primary author of [virt-manager](https://virt-manager.org).
* Long time developer and co-maintainer of [libvirt](https://libvirt.org).
* Born and raised and presently reside in the Boston MA area.
* Electronic music has been a big part of my life for roughly 20 years, in particular Drum + Bass, mostly attending shows with friends but occasionally DJing. Some of my personal DJ output can be found on [my soundcloud page](https://soundcloud.com/otcmdj).
* This site is hosted on github pages in these [two](https://github.com/crobinso/crobinso.github.io) [repos](https://github.com/crobinso/blog).

This site mostly exists to host [my blog](https://blog.wikichoon.com) of work related content.
