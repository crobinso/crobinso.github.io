Hello Fedora land!

My name is Cole Robinson, I'm a developer at Red Hat working on some of the userland virt stack (virt-manager, virt-install, libvirt) for Fedora, RHEL, and upstream.

I'll be posting in an effort to make things a bit more transparent in virt land, keeping people updated on developments that are coming down the pipe, and hopefully solicit feedback on some of the user facing bits. I'm on IRC as 'crobinso', so feel free to ping me if you have questions or problems with any of the above packages.

Some info about me: I'm 23, live in Massachusetts, and spend most of my money on dance music (largely drum + bass these days, though I really don't discriminate). So hello everyone!
