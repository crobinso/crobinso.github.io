  <div class="post-content">
    <p>Recently I played around with github a bit, with the intention of finding a useful setup for hosting <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/python-bugzilla/">python-bugzilla</a> (and possibly virt-manager). However I want to preserve the traditional open source mailing list driven development model.</p>
<p>github's whole development model is built around pull requests. Personally I kinda like the setup, but for a pre-existing project built around patches on a mailing list it's quite a different workflow.</p>
<p>github doesn't allow disabling the pull-request option. This is understandable since it's pretty central to their entire model. However my main sticking point is that <strong>github doesn't provide a straightforward way to send pull request notifications to a mailing list</strong>. I don't want everyone on a mailing list to have to opt in to watching the repo on github to be notified of pull requests. I want non-github users to be able to contribute to pull request discussions on a mailing list. I want pull requests on the project mailing list since it's already a part of my workflow. I don't want my project to be one of those that <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux">accumulates</a> <a href="https://github.com/libguestfs/libguestfs">ignored</a> <a href="https://github.com/qemu/qemu">pull-requests</a> because it isn't part of the project workflow and no one is watching the output.</p>
<p>Googling about this was quite frustrating, it was difficult to find a clear answer. I eventually found an <a href="https://github.com/github/github-services/pull/284">abandoned pull request to github-services</a> that made everything clear. But not before I tried quite a few things. Here's what I tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opening a github account using the mailing list address, 'watch' the repository. It works, but yeah, not too safe since anyone can just trigger a 'forgot password' reset email.</li>
<li>Put the repo in an 'organization', add the mailing list as a secondary address to your account, have all <a href="https://gist.github.com/BPScott/1366790">notifications for the organization</a> go to the mailing list. But even secondary accounts work for the password reset, so that's out.</li>
<li>'email' webhook/service: At your github repo, go to settings->webhooks &amp; services->configure services->email. Hey, this looks promising. The problem is it's quite limited in scope, only supporting email notifications for repo pushes and when  a public repo is added.</li>
<li>The actual webhook configuration is quite elaborate and allows notifying of pull-requests and everything else you would want to know, but that requires running an actual web service somewhere. But I have no interest in maintaining a public service just to proxy some email.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's a <a href="https://github.com/github/github-services">public repo for the bit of github</a> that the 'email' webhook lives under. I stuck <a href="https://github.com/github/github-services/issues/804#issuecomment-38390436">some thoughts on an open issue</a> that more or less tracks the RFE to extend the email capabilities.</p>
<p>Someone out there with some spare time and ruby-fu want to take a crack at this? I think many old school open source projects would be thankful for it :)</p>
