    <p><a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/virt-install">virt-install</a> is a command line tool for creating new virtual machines via libvirt. It's an important piece of the libvirt ecosystem that has shipped in RHEL5.0 and up, and over a dozen Fedora versions.</p>
<p>It wasn't always called virt-install though: it started life as xenguest-install.py written by <a href="http://velohacker.com/">Jeremy Katz</a>. I think it was just an internal Red Hat only thing for a brief period, until it first surfaced as part of the Fedora 'xen' package in <a href="http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/cgit/xen.git/commit/?id=02687b4e3f7fa0db5de34280a2cb7e1a8eb8ff18">January 2006</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>commit 02687b4e3f7fa0db5de34280a2cb7e1a8eb8ff18
Author: Stephen Tweedie &lt;sct@fedoraproject.org&gt;
Date:  Tue Jan 31 16:59:19 2006 +0000

  Add xenguest-install.py in /usr/sbin
</pre></div>


<p>(Strangely, the file isn't actually in git... I assume this is some accident of the CVS->git conversion. You can see the version shipped with Fedora Core 5 in the <a href="https://archives.fedoraproject.org/pub/archive/fedora/linux/core/5/x86_64/os/Fedora/RPMS/xen-3.0.1-4.x86_64.rpm">archived RPM</a>).</p>
<p>Check out the original set of arguments</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Options:
 -h, --help      show this help message and exit
 -n NAME, --name=NAME Name of the guest instance
 -f DISKFILE, --file=DISKFILE
            File to use as the disk image
 -s DISKSIZE, --file-size=DISKSIZE
            Size of the disk image (if it doesn&#39;t exist) in
            gigabytes
 -r MEMORY, --ram=MEMORY
            Memory to allocate for guest instance in megabytes
 -m MAC, --mac=MAC   Fixed MAC address for the guest; if none is given a
            random address will be used
 -v, --hvm       This guest should be a fully virtualized guest
 -c CDROM, --cdrom=CDROM
            File to use a virtual CD-ROM device for fully
            virtualized guests
 -p, --paravirt    This guest should be a paravirtualized guest
 -l LOCATION, --location=LOCATION
            Installation source for paravirtualized guest (eg,
            nfs:host:/path, http://host/path, ftp://host/path)
 -x EXTRA, --extra-args=EXTRA
            Additional arguments to pass to the installer with
            paravirt guests
</pre></div>


<p>All those bits are still working with virt-install today, although many are are deprecated and hidden from the --help output by default.</p>
<p>In early 2006, libvirt barely even existed, so the xenguest-install.py was generating <a href="http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/Xen_Configuration_File_Options">xen xm</a> config files (basically just raw python code) in /etc/xen.
Fedora CVS was the canonical home of the script.</p>
<p>In March 2006, <a href="http://berrange.com/">Dan Berrangé</a> <a href="https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/virt-manager.git/commit/?id=3ed0ef3">started work on virt-manager</a>. It was very briefly called gnome-vm-manager, then settled into gnome-virt-manager until July 2006 when it was <a href="https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/virt-manager.git/commit/?id=dc0d6db84cfe78c4a479381ead55bbd83c0cca55">renamed to virt-manager</a>.</p>
<p>In August 2006, xenguest-install moved to its own repo, <a href="https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/python-virtinst.git/commit/?id=1e2e1aa0ca0b5ed8669be61aa4271a3e8c1d7333">python-xeninst</a>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>commit 1e2e1aa0ca0b5ed8669be61aa4271a3e8c1d7333
Author: Jeremy Katz &lt;katzj@redhat.com&gt;
Date:  Tue Aug 8 21:37:49 2006 -0400

  first pass at breaking up xenguest-install to have more of a usable API.
  currently only works for paravirt and some of the bits after the install
  gets started are still a little less than ideal
</pre></div>


<p>Much of logic was moved to a 'xeninst' module. There were some initial bits for generating libvirt XML, but the primary usage was still generating native xen configuration.</p>
<p>(Both repositories were hosted in mercurial at hg.et.redhat.com for many years. We eventually <a href="http://www.redhat.com/archives/virt-tools-list/2011-March/msg00056.html">transitioned to git in March 2011</a>. Actually it's amazing it was only 3 years ago: I've pretty much entirely forgotten how to use mercurial despite using it for 4 years prior.)</p>
<p>In October 2006, the project was <a href="https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/python-virtinst.git/commit/?id=761ccd8a65a79737431aa1415d16b19ef9d8f9c8">renamed python-virtinst</a> and the tool renamed to virt-install. By this point virt-manager was using the xeninst module for guest creation and needed to <a href="https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/virt-manager.git/commit/?id=cd946bcfae2960c4769c5f12e235d1026a33328d">handle the rename</a> as well.</p>
<p>So now python-virtinst was its own standalone package, providing virt-install and a python library named virtinst. Over the next couple years the repo accumulated a few more tools: <a href="https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/python-virtinst.git/commit/?id=bfa6c18f94fdb9d30c30df494e4b338745e79f5e">virt-clone in May 2007</a>, <a href="https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/python-virtinst.git/commit/?id=c4d45ff7960bd84050bb382d597dc3cfdf3d3882">virt-image in June 2007</a>, and <a href="https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/python-virtinst.git/commit/?id=a0401fe359af0220ea3e609861042ad9f000d7d5">virt-convert (originally virt-unpack) in July 2008</a>.</p>
<p>However over the next few years we had some growing pains with the virtinst module. It wasn't exactly a planned API, rather a collection of code that grew organically from a quick hack of a script. It never received too much thought for future compatibility. The fact that it ended up as a public API was more historic accident than anything. Once we accumulated external users (<a href="https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/commit/dd569b1834e9611b8390d334e2016b0659253e72">cobbler in March 2007</a> and <a href="https://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/koji/commit/?id=64cc01be898547d150f0200111ff0e57176ecdd7">koji in July 2010</a>) we were stuck with the API in the name of back compatibility.</p>
<p>Then there was the general frustration of doing virt-manager development when it evolved in lockstep with virtinst: running upstream virt-manager always required running up to date python-virtinst, which was a barrier to upstream contribution.</p>
<p>So in February 2012 I layed out some reasons for <a href="http://www.redhat.com/archives/virt-tools-list/2012-February/msg00040.html">dropping virtinst as a public API and merging the code into virt-manager.git</a>, though it didn't fully happen until <a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/virt-tools-list/2013-April/msg00026.html">april 2013 during the virt-manager 0.10.0 cycle</a>. In the intervening year, I sent patches to koan and koji to move off virtinst to calling the needed virt-* tool directly.</p>
<p>So nowadays virtinst, virt-install, etc. all live with virt-manager.git. If you're looking for a library that helps handle libvirt XML or create libvirt VMs, check out <a href="http://libvirt.org/git/?p=libvirt-designer.git;a=summary">libvirt-designer</a> and <a href="http://libvirt.org/git/?p=libvirt-glib.git;a=summary">libvirt-gobject/libvirt-gconfig</a>.</p>
